# Course description

These materials accompany the 4-unit, 2-day, second course in statistics, [STAT 313 - Applied Experimental Design and Regression Models](https://atheobold.github.io/stat-313-website/), offered through the [Minor in Statistics](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/content/minors).

In this course, students learn how to prepare data for analysis using the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of R package. Specifically, students build proficiency with the `{dplyr}` and `{ggplot2}` packages. Students then use the [`{infer}`](https://infer.netlify.app/) package to fit various regression and ANOVA models, using both simulation-based and theoretical methods. Throughout the course, students use Quarto to create professional-looking statistical reports.

# When is this taught?

At Cal Poly, this course is taught every quarter. I expect to teach this course at some point in the academic year, so the materials should be updated at least once annually.
