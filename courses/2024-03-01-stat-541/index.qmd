# Course description

These materials accompany the 4-unit, 2-day, hands-on coding course, [STAT 331 - Statistical Computing in R](https://atheobold.github.io/groupworthy-data-science/), offered through the [Bachelors of Science in Statistics](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/content/curriculum).

In this course, students learn how to work with data in R using the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of package. Specifically, students build proficiency with the `{readr}`, `{readxl}`, `{ggplot}`, `{dplyr}`, `{tidyr}`, `{forcats}`, `{lubridate}`, `{janitor}` and `{stringr}` packages. Students learn to write their own, user-defined functions. The course ends with students exploring how to iterate functions over multiple inputs with the `{purrr}`package. Throughout the course, students create professional-looking Quarto documents and build proficiency working with GitHub.

# When is this taught?

At Cal Poly, this course is taught every spring quarter. There are a few of us who alternate teaching the course, so I may end up taking a break in the next few years.
