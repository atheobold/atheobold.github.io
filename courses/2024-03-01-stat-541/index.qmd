# Course description

These materials accompany the 4-unit, 2-day, hands-on coding course, [STAT 541 - Advanced Statistical Computing in R](https://github.com/atheobold/stat-541), offered through the [Masters in Statistics](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofsciencemathematics/statistics/#graduatetext).

In this course, students dive deeper into the statistical computing concepts they were introduced to in their [STAT 331 course](../2024-08-23-stat-331/index.qmd). Students explore more advanced visualization methods using `{leaflet}` and `{gganimate}`, learn how to create dashboards with `{shiny}`, retrieve data from APIs, scrape data from the web using `{rvest}` and `{httr2}`, create their own R packages with the help of `{usethis}`, and generate fun works of art. The later topics require an understanding of iterative programming, and makes use of the`{purrr}` package.

# When is this taught?

At Cal Poly, this course is taught every spring quarter. There are a few of us who alternate teaching the course, so I may end up taking a break in the next few years.
