# Course description

These materials accompany the 5-unit, 2-day, hands-on coding course, [DATA 301 - Introduction to Data Science](https://atheobold.github.io/data-301/), offered through the [Cross Disciplinary Minor in Data Science](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/data-science-minor).

In this course, students learn how to work with data in Python using [`{pandas}`](https://pandas.pydata.org/), create visualizations using [`{plotnine}`](https://plotnine.org/), and fit various supervised and unsupervised learning models using [`{scikitlearn}`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

# When is this taught?

At Cal Poly, this course is taught every quarter, typically alternating between Statistics faculty and Computer Science faculty. I expect to teach this course at some point in the academic year, so the materials should be updated at least once annually.
