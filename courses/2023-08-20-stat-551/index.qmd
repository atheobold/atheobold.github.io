# Course description

These materials accompany the 4-unit, 2-day, hands-on coding course, [STAT 551 - Statistical Learning with R](https://github.com/atheobold/stat-learning), offered through the [Masters in Statistics](https://catalog.calpoly.edu/collegesandprograms/collegeofsciencemathematics/statistics/#graduatetext).

In this course, students learn how to fit a variety of supervised and unsupervised models using the `{tidymodels}` set of packages. Specifically, students learn how to use `{recipe}` to specify the variables to be included in their model, use `{parsnip}` to set the engine to be used when fitting the model, and `{yardstick}` to assess the performance of each model.

# When is this taught?

At Cal Poly, this course is taught every fall quarter. There are a few of us who alternate teaching the course, so I did not end up teaching this course this year. However, I may end up teaching it in the coming years!
