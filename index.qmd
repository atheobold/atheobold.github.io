Hi there! I'm Allison Theobold. I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of
Statistics at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California. I love teaching any and 
all computing courses, especially our first computing course. I love R with all 
my heart, but am currently learning to like Python. As a researcher, I focus on 
ways whe can innovate our statistics and data science classrooms to be more 
equitable and inclusive of a diverse body of learners. Outside of work, you can 
find me running and biking on the trails in San Luis Obispo, watching womenâ€™s
basketball, cooking, and enjoying a good cup of coffee.
