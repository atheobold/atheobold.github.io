<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Various data technologies and automated approaches can assist with assessment, but care is needed to develop tools and practices that value and support the human learning experience, at the same time as optimising for efficiency and accuracy. Tools are also needed that support teachers to make consistent and valid judgments across very large quantities of responses.</p>
<p>The talks in this session present in research and practice within the emerging area of large scale automated-assisted assessment. Each speaker discusses their development of different innovative assessment practices and the opportunities, challenges, and rewards of using automation with respect to teaching and research. This presentation was the “discussion” coming at the end of the session, following the presentations by each of the four presenters. As such, the presentation focuses on summarizing key themes found within and between the talks, and situates these themes within the broader context of what it means to be a teacher.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Gamification—integrating game elements (e.g., badges, levels, leaderboards) to trigger extrinsic motivation—has been lauded for increasing student engagement and motivation. While gamification may create a more engaging educational environment, the use of game related mechanics fosters a competitive system where students compete for the top “prize.” Alternatively, gameful learning—incorporating game characteristics into learning activities—promote greater intrinsic motivation. These gameful activities create an environment where students expend serious effort, act creatively, take risks, and collaborate.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Despite the elevated importance of Data Science in Statistics, there exists limited research investigating how students learn the computing concepts and skills necessary for carrying out data science tasks. Computer Science educators have investigated how students debug their own code and how students reason through foreign code. While these studies illuminate different aspects of students’ programming behavior or conceptual understanding, a method has yet to be employed that can shed light on students’ learning processes. This type of inquiry necessitates qualitative methods, which allow for a holistic description of the skills a student uses throughout the computing code they produce, the organization of these descriptions into themes, and a comparison of the emergent themes across students or across time. In this article we share how to conceptualize and carry out the qualitative coding process with students’ computing code. Drawing on the Block Model to frame our analysis, we explore two types of research questions which could be posed about students’ learning. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Traditionally, statistical communication has focused on students’ writing, specifically how they communicate statistical ideas through written channels. While often overlooked, the code students produce during their data analyses also communicates important information about their thinking and learning. In this presentation I will outline a framework for analyzing students’ code as a relic of their learning. We will then explore four different ways this framework could be used to analyze students’ code, with an eye toward the understanding it communicates.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Over the last few years, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become a common topic of conversation in education. While many of these conversations revolve around “social justice” topics, we view DEI as a tool to inspect issues of power in the classroom. Specifically, we stand behind Gutierrez (2002) and declare that ultimately equity is about the distribution of power.</p>
<p>In this invited session, we dig into four critical areas where issues of equity manifest in the classroom: access, achievement, identity, and power. Access and achievement form the “dominant axis,” which focuses on preparing students to “play the game”—preparing them to participate economically in society. Identity and power form the “critical axis,” which focuses on building critical citizens so students can “change the game.” Each speaker provides insight into how they consider issues related to a specific dimension of equity in their classroom and offers strategies for dismantling inequities in the classroom that put power in student’s hands.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused the flaws of traditional grading systems to become even more apparent. In response, a growing number of educators are transitioning their classrooms to focus on alternative methods of assessment. These subversive methods promote more equitable assessments, as they provide a more accurate picture of what a student has learned, cultivate students’ intrinsic motivation, and do not privilege students from certain backgrounds. This article details how alternative grading, specifically “ungrading,” was integrated into an introductory data science course. I detail how the course components align with the principles of alternative grading, students’ responses to the course structure, and the lessons I learned along the way. Finally, I close with a discussion of how infusing alternative methods of assessment into the classroom stands to cultivate the diversity continually lacking in computer science and data science.</p>
