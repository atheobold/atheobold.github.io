<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Gamification—integrating game elements (e.g., badges, levels, leaderboards) to trigger extrinsic motivation—has been lauded for increasing student engagement and motivation. While gamification may create a more engaging educational environment, the use of game related mechanics fosters a competitive system where students compete for the top “prize.” Alternatively, gameful learning—incorporating game characteristics into learning activities—promote greater intrinsic motivation. These gameful activities create an environment where students expend serious effort, act creatively, take risks, and collaborate.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Traditionally, statistical communication has focused on students’ writing, specifically how they communicate statistical ideas through written channels. While often overlooked, the code students produce during their data analyses also communicates important information about their thinking and learning. In this presentation I will outline a framework for analyzing students’ code as a relic of their learning. We will then explore four different ways this framework could be used to analyze students’ code, with an eye toward the understanding it communicates.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Over the last few years, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become a common topic of conversation in education. While many of these conversations revolve around “social justice” topics, we view DEI as a tool to inspect issues of power in the classroom. Specifically, we stand behind Gutierrez (2002) and declare that ultimately equity is about the distribution of power.</p>
<p>In this invited session, we dig into four critical areas where issues of equity manifest in the classroom: access, achievement, identity, and power. Access and achievement form the “dominant axis,” which focuses on preparing students to “play the game”—preparing them to participate economically in society. Identity and power form the “critical axis,” which focuses on building critical citizens so students can “change the game.” Each speaker provides insight into how they consider issues related to a specific dimension of equity in their classroom and offers strategies for dismantling inequities in the classroom that put power in student’s hands.</p>

<p>This presentation was presented at the 2023 Joint Statistical Meetings, as part of a session on four ways educators can view equity in their classroom. There are two other incredible presentations as part of this session—<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qDoPp7Y2H0DjmDDb1W0jphDN_P1HeM65McyNqcbQkOQ/edit?usp=sharing">Access as the intersection of resources and practices</a> by Dr.&nbsp;Leslie Myint and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jkE90LkjwSwPc5p1w7qB7SHqiIpaYdQ64vZqLsAvpcU/edit?usp=sharing">Rethinking grading systems in intro and advanced statistics courses</a> by Dr.&nbsp;Kelsey Grinde.</p>
