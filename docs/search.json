While often overlooked, the code students produce during their data analyses also communicates important information about their thinking and learning. In this presentation I will outline a framework for analyzing students’ code as a relic of their learning. We will then explore four different ways this framework could be used to analyze students’ code, with an eye toward the understanding it communicates.\n\n\nAudience\nThis presentation was part of the IMSI Conference on Teaching and Evaluating Communication at Scale, and is targeted toward educators who are interested in evaluating students’ code as a product of their learning."

    "text": "slides\n\n\nAbstract\nOver the last few years, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become a common topic of conversation in education. While many of these conversations revolve around “social justice” topics, we view DEI as a tool to inspect issues of power in the classroom. Specifically, we stand behind Gutierrez (2002) and declare that ultimately equity is about the distribution of power.\nIn this invited session, we dig into four critical areas where issues of equity manifest in the classroom: access, achievement, identity, and power. Access and achievement form the “dominant axis,” which focuses on preparing students to “play the game”—preparing them to participate economically in society. Identity and power form the “critical axis,” which focuses on building critical citizens so students can “change the game.” Each speaker provides insight into how they consider issues related to a specific dimension of equity in their classroom and offers strategies for dismantling inequities in the classroom that put power in student’s hands.\n\n\nAudience\nThis presentation was presented at the 2023 Joint Statistical Meetings, as part of a session on four ways educators can view equity in their classroom. There are two other incredible presentations as part of this session—Access as the intersection of resources and practices by Dr. Leslie Myint and Rethinking grading systems in intro and advanced statistics courses by Dr. Kelsey Grinde."

While gamification may create a more engaging educational environment, the use of game related mechanics fosters a competitive system where students compete for the top “prize.” Alternatively, gameful learning—incorporating game characteristics into learning activities—promote greater intrinsic motivation. These gameful activities create an environment where students expend serious effort, act creatively, take risks, and collaborate.\n\n\nAudience\nThese materials are geared toward anyone teaching introductory programming in R. I’ve linked the GitHub repository with the activities, and we are happy to have people contribute more activities!"
