    "text": "Hi there! I’m Allison Theobold. I’m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California. I love teaching any and all computing courses, especially our first computing course. I love R with all my heart, but am currently learning to like Python. As a researcher, I focus on ways whe can innovate our statistics and data science classrooms to be more equitable and inclusive of a diverse body of learners. Outside of work, you can find me running and biking on the trails in San Luis Obispo, watching women’s basketball, cooking, and enjoying a good cup of coffee."
