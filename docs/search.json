    "text": "slides  source code\n\n\nAbstract\nTraditionally, statistical communication has focused on students’ writing, specifically how they communicate statistical ideas through written channels. While often overlooked, the code students produce during their data analyses also communicates important information about their thinking and learning. In this presentation I will outline a framework for analyzing students’ code as a relic of their learning. We will then explore four different ways this framework could be used to analyze students’ code, with an eye toward the understanding it communicates.\n\n\nAudience\nThis presentation was part of the IMSI Conference on Teaching and Evaluating Communication at Scale, and is targeted toward educators who are interested in evaluating students’ code as a product of their learning."

    "text": "slides  source code\n\n\nAbstract\nGamification—integrating game elements (e.g., badges, levels, leaderboards) to trigger extrinsic motivation—has been lauded for increasing student engagement and motivation. While gamification may create a more engaging educational environment, the use of game related mechanics fosters a competitive system where students compete for the top “prize.” Alternatively, gameful learning—incorporating game characteristics into learning activities—promote greater intrinsic motivation. These gameful activities create an environment where students expend serious effort, act creatively, take risks, and collaborate.\n\n\nAudience\nThese materials are geared toward anyone teaching introductory programming in R. I’ve linked the GitHub repository with the activities, and we are happy to have people contribute more activities!"
