While often overlooked, the code students produce during their data analyses also communicates important information about their thinking and learning. In this presentation I will outline a framework for analyzing students’ code as a relic of their learning. We will then explore four different ways this framework could be used to analyze students’ code, with an eye toward the understanding it communicates.\n\n\nAudience\nThis presentation was part of the IMSI Conference on Teaching and Evaluating Communication at Scale, and is targeted toward educators who are interested in evaluating students’ code as a product of their learning."

    "text": "slides\n\n\nAbstract\nOver the last few years, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become a common topic of conversation in education. While many of these conversations revolve around “social justice” topics, we view DEI as a tool to inspect issues of power in the classroom. Specifically, we stand behind Gutierrez (2002) and declare that ultimately equity is about the distribution of power.\nIn this invited session, we dig into four critical areas where issues of equity manifest in the classroom: access, achievement, identity, and power. Access and achievement form the “dominant axis,” which focuses on preparing students to “play the game”—preparing them to participate economically in society. Identity and power form the “critical axis,” which focuses on building critical citizens so students can “change the game.” Each speaker provides insight into how they consider issues related to a specific dimension of equity in their classroom and offers strategies for dismantling inequities in the classroom that put power in student’s hands.\n\n\nAudience\nThis presentation was presented at the 2023 Joint Statistical Meetings, as part of a session on four ways educators can view equity in their classroom. There are two other incredible presentations as part of this session—Access as the intersection of resources and practices by Dr. Leslie Myint and Rethinking grading systems in intro and advanced statistics courses by Dr. Kelsey Grinde."

While gamification may create a more engaging educational environment, the use of game related mechanics fosters a competitive system where students compete for the top “prize.” Alternatively, gameful learning—incorporating game characteristics into learning activities—promote greater intrinsic motivation. These gameful activities create an environment where students expend serious effort, act creatively, take risks, and collaborate.\n\n\nAudience\nThis talk was presented at the 2024 electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics (eCOTS).

    "text": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused the flaws of traditional grading systems to become even more apparent. In response, a growing number of educators are transitioning their classrooms to focus on alternative methods of assessment. These subversive methods promote more equitable assessments, as they provide a more accurate picture of what a student has learned, cultivate students’ intrinsic motivation, and do not privilege students from certain backgrounds. This article details how alternative grading, specifically “ungrading,” was integrated into an introductory data science course. I detail how the course components align with the principles of alternative grading, students’ responses to the course structure, and the lessons I learned along the way. Finally, I close with a discussion of how infusing alternative methods of assessment into the classroom stands to cultivate the diversity continually lacking in computer science and data science.\n\n slides  slides\n\n\n\nAudience\nThis presentation was presented at the 2023 International Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nDespite the elevated importance of Data Science in Statistics, there exists limited research investigating how students learn the computing concepts and skills necessary for carrying out data science tasks. Computer Science educators have investigated how students debug their own code and how students reason through foreign code. While these studies illuminate different aspects of students’ programming behavior or conceptual understanding, a method has yet to be employed that can shed light on students’ learning processes. This type of inquiry necessitates qualitative methods, which allow for a holistic description of the skills a student uses throughout the computing code they produce, the organization of these descriptions into themes, and a comparison of the emergent themes across students or across time. In this article we share how to conceptualize and carry out the qualitative coding process with students’ computing code. Drawing on the Block Model to frame our analysis, we explore two types of research questions which could be posed about students’ learning. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n slides  published paper\n\n\n\nAudience\nThis presentation was presented for the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education January webinar."

Tools are also needed that support teachers to make consistent and valid judgments across very large quantities of responses.\nThe talks in this session present in research and practice within the emerging area of large scale automated-assisted assessment. Each speaker discusses their development of different innovative assessment practices and the opportunities, challenges, and rewards of using automation with respect to teaching and research. This presentation was the “discussion” coming at the end of the session, following the presentations by each of the four presenters. As such, the presentation focuses on summarizing key themes found within and between the talks, and situates these themes within the broader context of what it means to be a teacher.\n\n\nAudience\nThis presentation was presented at the 2024 Joint Statistical Meetings."

With Quarto, you can create documents, books, presentations, websites, or other online resources. The workshop is comprised of three modules. Module 1 will introduce you to Quarto documents, for both student and instructor use. We will demonstrate how we use Quarto documents and RStudio’s Visual Editor to introduce students to reproducible workflows. We will also demonstrate how Quarto documents can be used to create and distribute teaching resources. Modules 2 and 3 will extend the use of Quarto to create teaching resources, outlining how Quarto can be used to create course slides and course websites. We will conclude with tips on how to make your materials publicly available to share with students and other educators.\n\n\n\n\n\n website  source code\n\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop was presented at the 2023 US Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS).

    "text": "Abstract\n“Many USCOTS attendees are committed to inclusive teaching practices, but creating inclusive classrooms necessitates being aware of different identities, perspectives, and experiences and how they intersect with student’s experiences in the classroom. However, curricular materials and / or pedagogical practices can diminish certain student’s identities, leaving them uninterested in the disciplines of statistics and data science.\nThis workshop consists of two segments. The first segment, LGBTQ+ Identities, will be dedicated to a “Safe Zone” style workshop where participants are introduced to core concepts of marginalized genders and sexualities. The second segment, Creating Inclusive Classrooms & Addressing Microaggressions, will focus on setting up classrooms which create inclusive spaces and ways to address microaggressions that arise. We will describe a variety of microaggressions that may occur (e.g., ableism, heterosexism, transnegativity), and discuss strategies for responding to microaggressions in the classroom. Research suggests practicing difficult conversations is essential for achieving an inclusive classroom environment.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n slides  drive with workshop materials\n\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop was presented at the 2023 US Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS)."
