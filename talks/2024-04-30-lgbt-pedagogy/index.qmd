# Abstract

In this post, we apply the three-question design decision framework outlined by Dr. Nicole Dalzell ([in the previous blog post](https://stattlc.com/2024/04/11/evaluating-pedagogical-choices-with-an-inclusive-approach/)) to evaluate curricular and pedagogical choices that specifically impact lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals in the classroom.
