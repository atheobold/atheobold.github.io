# Abstract

Many educators are committed to inclusive teaching practices, but creating inclusive classrooms necessitates being aware of different identities, perspectives, and experiences and how they intersect with student’s experiences in the classroom. However, curricular materials and / or pedagogical practices can diminish certain student’s identities, leaving them uninterested in the disciplines of statistics and data science. 

This workshop consists of two segments. The first segment, LGBTQ+ Identities, will be dedicated to a “Safe Zone” style workshop where participants are introduced to core concepts of marginalized genders and sexualities. The second segment, Creating Inclusive Classrooms & Addressing Microaggressions, will focus on setting up classrooms which create inclusive spaces and ways to address microaggressions that arise. We will describe a variety of microaggressions that may occur (e.g., ableism, heterosexism, transnegativity), and discuss strategies for responding to microaggressions in the classroom. Research suggests practicing difficult conversations is essential for achieving an inclusive classroom environment.
